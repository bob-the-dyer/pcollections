# pcollections

This repo contains implementation of Persistent collection based on Red-Black Tree. 

To build and run tests you need maven to me installed on your machine:
#####mvn clean package

###Persistence implementation to consider:
  - tree usage as an underlying structure for set vs map -> set
  - full persistence vs. partial -> full one
  - full copy on modification vs. minimal required copy of subtrees -> ???
  
###Other aspects to consider:
  - thread safety on modification -> NO
