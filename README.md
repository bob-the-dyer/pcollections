# pcollections

This project contains two Persistent Set implementations based on:
  - an ordinary binary tree 
  - a Red-Black tree

To build project and run unit tests you need maven to be preinstalled on your machine:
##### mvn clean package

### Main usage example

TODO here to add 3 lines of code for BinaryTreeSet usage
TODO here to add 3 lines of code for PersistentRedBlackTreeSet usage

See unit tests for more examples of BinaryTreeSet and PersistentRedBlackTreeSet usage

### General aspects that were considered:

  - tree usage as an underlying structure for Set vs. Map -> Set
  - thread safety on modification / copying -> NO
  - elements of the set should be serializable(->YES), cloneable(->NO) and comparable(->YES) types
  - clone/copy objects on insert to preserve tree invariants consistency from external change of inserted elements -> NO
  - collection friendly (equals, hashCode) -> NO
  - null elements are allowed -> NO
  - collection should be serialisation ready -> YES

### Persistence implementation that was considered:

  - full persistence vs. partial -> full persistence
  - full copy on modification vs. minimal required copy of subtrees -> full copy
  
### Implementation plan:

  - design, build and test binary tree based Set: contains, insert, remove, size, iterate - V
  - add persistence for binary tree and tests - V
  - "colorize" the Set: add insert/delete recoloring and rebalancing logic to keep RBTree invariants valid - IN PROGRESS
  - add unit tests to prove RBTree invariants valid on insert/delete - IN PROGRESS  
  - add persistence for RBTree and tests   
  - benchmarking
  - interfaces refactoring, adding convenience methods, see TODOs (?)
  - javadocs (?)
